# VISTAFiRe: Visual Interpretation of the SpatioTemporal Arrangement of Fire Regimes
_Nikki C. Inglis, 2020_

### What is VISTAFiRe?
VISTAFiRe is a visual analytics tool for exploring spatiotemporal dynamics in fire regime histories. 

It is based on fire history visualizations documented [here](https://buzzfeednews.github.io/2018-07-wildfire-trends/), crafted by Buzzfeed News journalist [Peter Aldhous](https://github.com/paldhous) in 2018.
